                OpenTTD's survey is opt-in: it will not send any data unless you explicitly say you want to participate.
                If you participate, the game will send a survey result whenever you leave a game, whether by loading another, going to the main menu, exiting the game, or if the game crashes.
            </p>
            <p>
                The survey has been designed around a few ground rules:
                <ul>
                    <li>No personal data and no data to track a specific user.</li>
                    <li>The user is in control: you can opt-out at any time, and review the survey result at any time (via "Game Options" in-game).</li>
                    <li>Minimize how often we send survey results.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                With this in mind, we collect the following information of every game:
                <ul>
                    <li>The settings as they are at the end of the game.</li>
                    <li>The NewGRFs used by the game.</li>
                    <li>The companies, whether they are human or AI, and in case of AI: what script was running. Additionally, how many vehicles and infrastructure each company has.</li>
                    <li>How long the game has been running.</li>
                    <li>Basic information about your OS / CPU.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                This information is used on this website to show statistics about how OpenTTD is used.

            <p>
                As mentioned in the last section and introduction, the survey is designed to be privacy friendly.
                This means the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We do not track users.
                        With this we mean that no information is collected that can be used to track a specific user.
                        Everything is as generic as possible.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Results are only published when sufficient surveys (N > 100) have been collected.
                        If the sample size were too small, it might be possible to identify a single user.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We do not store any information other than the survey results.
                        This means we do not store IP addresses, or any other information that can be used to identify a user, next to the survey results.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                To prevent abuse of this system, there are several measures in place.
                For example, you cannot send a survey result more than once every minute.
                This is done based on the IP address, and handled by a separate system than the one that handles the survey results.
                Your IP address is never stored with the survey results.
